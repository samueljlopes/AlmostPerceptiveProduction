      <description>&amp;lsquo;The eternal silence of these endless spaces terrifies me.&amp;rsquo; - Blaise Pascal In Andrew Hui&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;lsquo;A Theory of the Aphorism&amp;rsquo; (which you can purchase here), he describes aphorisms as a phrase which &amp;lsquo;condenses&amp;rsquo;. It transforms a epic into a book, a book into a page, and a page into a single, pithy phrase that can be thought upon and pondered over, relentlessly. Hui picks six key thinkers as representative of his theories on aphorism - three &amp;lsquo;ancients&amp;rsquo;, three &amp;lsquo;moderns&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;There are things known and there are things unknown, and in between are the doors of perception.&amp;rsquo; - Aldous Huxley. It&amp;rsquo;s always difficult to begin something, I find. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to declare to yourself, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to do that thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to do, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to start&amp;hellip; wait for it&amp;hellip; now!&amp;rsquo; You might get a warm glow for a little while, flush with your own decisiveness and go-getter attitude, but in the heat of the moment, you never actually get around to doing anything at all.</description>
