      <description>If everybody always lies to you, the consequence is not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer - Hannah Arendt#document.getElementById(&#39;blackout1&#39;).onmouseover = function() {mouseOver()};document.getElementById(&#39;blackout1&#39;).onmouseout = function() {mouseOut()};function mouseOver() {document.getElementById(&#39;blackout1&#39;).style.backgroundColor = &#34;transparent&#34;;}function mouseOut() {document.getElementById(&#39;blackout1&#39;).style.backgroundColor = &#34;rgb(15, 15, 15)&#34;;} China&amp;rsquo;s sphere of influence appears to be expanding every day. They have even absorbed the internet into the Party, against all expectations to the contrary.</description>

      <description>The Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels. A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have. The Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy (not the guide itself, the actual novel) occupies a rare space in the Western psyche - enough people know about it and are familiar with its material to get the reference but not enough are in order to illicit any sort of acknowledgement of the fact.</description>

      <description>The theme of this week appears to be bureaucracy. From the years-long mismanagement that caused a large store of ammonium nitrate to ignite in Beirut, or the scandal over exam results in the UK following the pandemic, incompetence and institutions appear to go hand in hand. The word people used to describe the opaque workings of national institution is &amp;lsquo;Kafkaesque&amp;rsquo;, where the object of power cannot be clearly seen. It was not just one man&amp;rsquo;s failing that brought about the devastation in Beirut, but a large and complex web of smaller incompetencies and misunderstandings that led to one catastrophic conclusion.</description>

      <title>I is a strange loop.</title>

      <description>Gödel, Escher, Bach (GEB) is a rare book than manages to seep into the collective consciousness without anyone having realised. What has been described as &amp;lsquo;a philosophy book disguised as a book of entertainment disguised as a book of instruction&amp;rsquo; made a big splash when it was first released, even winning the 1980 Pulitzer Prize, has managed to fade away into a cult classic. This is surprising for two reasons; it makes a series of fascinating and insightful points, and it arrived at an pivotal point in the development of modern-day artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>The (99%) Invisible Hand.</title>

      <description>How inequality makes bad design It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that the West has a inequality problem. Since 1980, the share of overall income going to the top 1% of earners in the US, UK and Australia has increased sharply. In fact, the economist Thomas Piketty has even gone so far to say that the US has a level of inequality &amp;lsquo;probably higher than in any other society at any time in the past, anywhere in the world&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>The worst offence of social media is the theft of the capacity for reverie - Richard Seymour Since we&amp;rsquo;ve all been spending a lot more time indoors, social media has become a lot more important for a lot of us. It offered an escape from the empty streets and time-stopped storefronts and reminded us that things continued to happen, bad things, mostly, as the death tolls continued to rise.
The contrast between things never fails to amaze me, especially on the major social networks.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;When I’m writing novels, reality and unreality just naturally get mixed together&amp;rsquo; - Haruki Murakami I&amp;rsquo;ve recently finished reading Haruki Murakami&amp;rsquo;s Killing Commedatore, and wanted to explore the themes of magical realism further. To be clear, magical realism is not the same as fantasy; In a very simple nutshell, magical realism is what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe. The genre itself has certain political connotations, especially with those who believe that it should remain strongly connected to its Latin-American roots.</description>

      <title>The aphorism is already a shadow of itself.</title>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;The eternal silence of these endless spaces terrifies me.&amp;rsquo; - Blaise Pascal In Andrew Hui&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;lsquo;A Theory of the Aphorism&amp;rsquo; (which you can purchase here), he describes aphorisms as a phrase which &amp;lsquo;condenses&amp;rsquo;. It transforms a epic into a book, a book into a page, and a page into a single, pithy phrase that can be thought upon and pondered over, relentlessly. Hui picks six key thinkers as representative of his theories on aphorism - three &amp;lsquo;ancients&amp;rsquo;, three &amp;lsquo;moderns&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <title>Everything must have a beginning.</title>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;There are things known and there are things unknown, and in between are the doors of perception.&amp;rsquo; - Aldous Huxley. It&amp;rsquo;s always difficult to begin something, I find. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to declare to yourself, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to do that thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to do, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to start&amp;hellip; wait for it&amp;hellip; now!&amp;rsquo; You might get a warm glow for a little while, flush with your own decisiveness and go-getter attitude, but in the heat of the moment, you never actually get around to doing anything at all.</description>
