      <description>&amp;lsquo;There are things known and there are things unknown, and in between are the doors of perception.&amp;rsquo; - Aldous Huxley. It&amp;rsquo;s always difficult to begin something, I find. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to declare to yourself, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to do that thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to do, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to start&amp;hellip; wait for it&amp;hellip; now!&amp;rsquo; You might get a warm glow for a little while, flush with your own decisiveness and go-getter attitude, but in the heat of the moment, you never actually get around to doing anything at all.</description>
