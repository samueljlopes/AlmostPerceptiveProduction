<p>China&rsquo;s sphere of influence appears to be expanding every day. They have even absorbed the internet into the Party, against all expectations to the contrary. In 2000, Bill Clinton joked that China&rsquo;s attempts to censor the internet was like trying &lsquo;to nail Jell-O to a wall.&rsquo; And yet, over the past 20 years, they have succeeded. The CCP, under Xi Jinping, has incorporated capitalism into their country whilst maintaining an iron authoritarian grip over the citizens of China. Through careful control of public figures, a stranglehold on public discourse and iron repression of dissenting voices, the CCP has managed to quell the disruptive influence of the internet and turned it into just another tool of the Party.</p>

<p>Such things are not new to China; its authoritarian tradition goes back to 220BCE with the unification of China under the Ch&rsquo;in dynasty. It rejected the moral standards of the Confucianists and instead embraced the accumulation of power, the subjugation of the individual to the state and the uniformity of thought. Sound familiar? Rather than reaching for a state of virtue, like the Confucianists did, it looked to the present in place of moral doctrines. It demanded concrete results achieved by its three key tenets - law, statecraft and power.</p>
<p>The CCP is not the &lsquo;legalist&rsquo; party (although it places great emphasis on the undisputed and sacred nature of the rule of law). They go further than the emperors of old could have possibly imagined. In her book <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> she claims that China has created a new kind of unaccountable power: instrumentarianism. She defines this as the instrumentalisation of behaviour for the purposes of modification, prediction, monetisation and control. Instrumentarianism can determine the ends, because it can manipulate the means. Having destroyed trust by annihilating all social institutions and, in the process, creating a ravenous materialist middle class, the CCP has used technology as a means of recreating confidence in the Party artificially.</p>
<p>In his book <em>We have been harmonised</em>, Kai Strittmatter comes to the conclusion that everything about the West&rsquo;s perception of China is wrong. In the West, capitalism and democracy appear to go hand-in-hand. China, in constant, has replaced the traditions of pre-Communist China with pure materialist greed, all in service to the Party. In a perverse Orwellian fantasy, the Party transcends monitoring you through a &lsquo;telescreen&rsquo; by making the object of surveillance the device with which 60% of the population use as their primary method of communication with the outside world.</p>
<p>With their new instrumentarian power, it is easier than ever for the CCP to disconnect truth from reality. Each citizen is given a &lsquo;social credit score&rsquo; that monitors their behaviour, purchases and even friendships to identify &lsquo;model citizens&rsquo; or &lsquo;betrayers of trust&rsquo;. The values and expectations are woven into everyday life in a way that the Soviet Union could have only dreamed. With this seemingly unlimited hold over its people, the CCP is able to indulge in bouts of collective amnesia. The anniversary of the Tienanmen Square massacre last year went entirely unmarked. By controlling the present and the past, the Party holds the future.</p>
<p>The CCP, in contrast to the predictions of the Western consensus on the intertwined nature of democracy and capitalism, have embraced digital technology and used its intrinsic knowledge of comprehensive surveillance to construct a novel networked totalitarian state with massive ambitions. Does this matter to a Western audience? Absolutely. From 1946 to 1989, we lived in a bipolar world with two alternative systems – ours and the Soviet Union’s – locked in a cold war. Then, after the dissolution of the USSR, we briefly had a world dominated by a single hyperpower free to make its own gigantic mistakes with impunity. China’s modernisation means that bipolarity has returned and, once again, a credible alternative to the Western system has materialised. Yet we remain obsessed with Russia – which aims to disrupt rather than displace – and not with China. To prevent the rise of capitalist instrumentarianism in the West, we must rid outside of our naivete and Oriental prejudices and critically evaluate China as we have never done before.</p>

<p>Thank you all once again for reading this edition of <em>Almost Perceptive</em>. Once again, this was bi-weekly, simply because I wanted to understand this topic fully and all the reading took two weeks rather than one. I heartily recommend both <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> and <em>We Have Been Harmonised</em>. I mentioned legalism at the beginning of this article - if you would like to learn more, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7smn1">A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy</a> is the reference material I used and is probably your best bet. Thanks, and I shall see you all again soon.</p>
