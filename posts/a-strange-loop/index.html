<p><em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em> (GEB) is a rare book than manages to seep into the collective consciousness without anyone having realised. What has been described as &lsquo;a philosophy book disguised as a book of entertainment disguised as a book of instruction&rsquo; made a big splash when it was first released, even winning the 1980 Pulitzer Prize, has managed to fade away into a cult classic. This is surprising for two reasons; it makes a series of fascinating and insightful points, and it arrived at an pivotal point in the development of modern-day artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The promise of true AI has been delivered at numerous times over the past 50 years. However, the vector of a computer as a machine for delivering a new &lsquo;artificial&rsquo; intelligence is one that follows instructions precisely. A computer never will do anything new or unexpected, as least from its own perspective, and this is what makes it a computer rather than some other thing. This was the issue that computer scientists were facing towards the end of the 1970s, especially as the lavish funding it has received from the US department of defence (ARPA, later renamed to DARPA) was drying up in the face of increased scrutiny on spending over military projects. This is where <em>GEB</em> comes in, and yet its insights were not taken forward into AI research today.</p>
<p>Signifying an old and yet little-understood concept, the term “strange loop” was coined by Douglas Hofstadter to describe an abstract loop in which, in the series of stages that constitute cycling around, there is a shift from one level of abstraction to another, which feels like an successive upwards movement. Yet, somehow, the successive “upward” shifts turn out to give rise to a closed cycle.</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;That is, despite one’s sense of departing ever further from one’s origin, one winds up, to one’s shock, exactly where one had started out.'</em></p>

<p>What is key in determining whether a looped structure is “strange” or not is the appearance and sudden disappearance of progression and hierarchy — it is not sufficient that the structure simply loop back on itself. The oldest and perhaps simplest strange loop to understand is the Epimenides Paradox, which simply goes,</p>
<p><strong>Epimenides was a Cretan who said &lsquo;All Cretans are liars.'</strong> If we take the statement as true, then because Epimenides is a Cretan, he must be lying. But, if he is lying, and we take the statement as false, he is lying about lying, and so the statement is true. But Epimenides is a Cretan, and so must be lying, etc. Round and round we go, stuck in a strange loop of self-reference.</p>
<p>The ideas of the Austrian-born logician Kurt Gödel, the third character in GEB, are most relevant to why a strange loop might be the key to consciousness in humans, and maybe one day, machines.</p>
<p>Gödel proposed one of the most extraordinary and revolutionary theorems in mathematics.  But in 1931, Gödel showed that within any sufficiently complex mathematical system there will always be true statements about numbers that cannot be proved true within that system. Named the &lsquo;incompleteness theorem&rsquo;, it shows limits to what mathematics can know. But how did Gödel prove this? It is a thorny problem, trying to get mathematics to define itself, and many mathematics before him tried to prove the opposite; most notably, <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, written by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead, who tried to lay solid foundations for all of mathematics by the use of set theory.</p>
<p>The way Gödel proved his theorem was to show that mathematics was rich enough to be able to talk about itself. He constructed a numerical code – referred to as the Gödel code, or Gödel numbers – that meant any statement about numbers had its own number. But this meant that numbers could stand for two things: numbers in their own right or code for statements about numbers. Using this coding he was able to turn the seemingly paradoxical statement “This statement has no proof” into an equation about numbers.</p>
<p>Any equation is true or false. If this particular equation is false it means the statement does have a proof, but proof implies truth. So, it can’t be false. That means the equation and therefore the statement must be true. Which in turn means here is a true statement in mathematics with no proof. By using self-reference and strange loops, Gödel manoeuvred mathematics into proving its own limitations.</p>
<p>Hofstadter believes that, just as mathematics is rich enough to talk about itself using this mixing of levels, the brain’s ability to be conscious of itself may be because of a similar ability, a similar &lsquo;looping&rsquo;. The brain, he thinks, has achieved sufficient complexity to code up knowledge about itself. Whereas a computer&rsquo;s learning is trained (think of deep learning, relying on massive data sets) or hard-wired, the human brain can alter itself just through cognizance of it&rsquo;s own structure. Just as Gödel showed mathematics can talk about itself using these logical strange loops, for Hofstadter, the “I” of consciousness is the result of a singular strange loop in the brain’s network. We are all strange, it seems.</p>

<p>Phew. I apologise if this week&rsquo;s post was a little too theoretical. I bought <em>GEB</em> a while ago, having been intrigued by the title. The book arrived, and I was faced with this tome, a literal tome, far heaver (and its pages thinner) than nearly all the book I had bought up until this point. I admit, it was the first book that ever intimidated me, and so, on my bookshelf it remained until a couple of weeks ago, when I had run out of reading material. It really is fascinating, and I would heartily recommend it to anyone interested in science, maths, computer science - really, anything. There is good reason why it was so well received on launch, 40 years ago. If you want to read more, here is a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/">interview</a> with Hofstadter in <em>The Atlantic</em>, as well as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/mar/09/bach-escher-godel-douglas-hofstadter-consciousness-ai-revolution-mathematical-idea-art-music">piece</a> related to strange loops in <em>The Guardian</em>. Thank you for reading, and I shall see you all next week on <em>Almost Perceptive</em>.</p>
