<h2 id="when-im-writing-novels-reality-and-unreality-just-naturally-get-mixed-together---haruki-murakami">&lsquo;When I’m writing novels, reality and unreality just naturally get mixed together&rsquo; - Haruki Murakami<a class="anchor" href="#when-im-writing-novels-reality-and-unreality-just-naturally-get-mixed-together---haruki-murakami">#</a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently finished reading Haruki Murakami&rsquo;s <em>Killing Commedatore</em>, and wanted to explore the themes of magical realism further. To be clear, magical realism is not the same as fantasy; In a very simple nutshell, magical realism is what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe. The genre itself has certain political connotations, especially with those who believe that it should remain strongly connected to its Latin-American roots.</p>
<p>Murakami, however, employs the genre to a different effect. He uses magical realism not as a contrast to protest some deep-seated injustice (most of the time - there is certainly some social commentary within his work) but as a way to explore an individual&rsquo;s identity. There are a number of distinct tropes (or Murakami-isms) running through his work - most notably, the use of light and dark to correspond to a conscious Self and a unconscious Other.</p>

<p><em>Killing Commedatore</em> is no exception to this. Throughout the novel, Murakami consistently mentions a pit, next to a traditional Shinto shrine in the foothills of Odawara. The darkness of the pit is used as a metaphor for unconsciousness - the protagonist is deposited there after his <em>Dante&rsquo;s Inferno</em>-like descent into the world of metaphors and Ideas. Similarly, the Commedatore is given corporeal form after being released from the pit - relinquished from unconscious Dark into the conscious Light of the pit&rsquo;s mountainous surroundings. Whilst trapped in the pit, the protagonist is reduced to his animals instincts; there is no discernible difference between conscious and unconscious, only the constant ringing of the small bell in a fruitless attempt to signal for help. This is in contrast the the introspective climax of the work just before, where the protagonist confronts a maleficent &lsquo;Double Metaphor&rsquo; as he struggles to coalesce his own individual identity.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the magical, otherworldly elements in Murakami&rsquo;s work are strictly introspective. This is also social commentary built into this dissection of the Self. In many of his earlier works, he rails against the proliferation of a fixed societal identity in post-war Japan and subsequent struggles to find identity outside that of a &lsquo;salaryman&rsquo; (a white-collar worker who can often stay with one company their entire working life), a factory worker, or some other pre-determined role. The &lsquo;magical&rsquo; does not enter into <em>Killing Commedatore</em> until surprisingly late in the work, after the protagonist has fled from a loveless marriage and has become the caretaker of another artist&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>For Murakami, this quest for identity is not a question of &lsquo;filling a role&rsquo; but instead a matter of will. It is the protagonist himself who first unwraps the painting Killing Commedatore from its hiding place in the attic and the protagonist who summons up the willpower to re-enact the painting and enter into the world of Metaphor. There is a surprising amount of passivity in Murakami&rsquo;s characters - Menshiki passively watches from his mansion (in a homage to <em>the Great Gatsby</em>) and Mariye who passively sits for her portrait in the latter half of the novel. Yet all of them seek identity by rooting about in their internal minds, recognizing that the inner mind is the ultimate source of Self.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;magical&rsquo; in Murakami&rsquo;s works is not a way of referring back to a pre-War nostalgia (although there is reference to Japanese mythological figures in a number of instances) but a facilitator for the journey of discovery on the part of the &lsquo;real&rsquo; characters of the novel. The Commedatore and the other magical figures all have a distinct function, whether that is to be stabbed or to ferry the protagonist across an unyielding &lsquo;metaphorical river&rsquo;. Ultimately, the two worlds of the novel are synthesised in order to allow the characters to confront their Other and emerge more fully realised that they were before.</p>

And you can’t necessarily tell the difference between this side and the other side.&rsquo;<a class="anchor" href="#so-in-my-stories-if-you-go-down-to-the-bottom-of-a-well-theres-another-world-and-you-cant-necessarily-tell-the-difference-between-this-side-and-the-other-side">#</a></h2>
<p>Thank you all for putting up with another entry into <em>Almost Perceptive</em>. Like many of you at the moment, I have been in lockdown for a number of months and so have read a lot since early spring. These first few entries will differ in content - this week was a literary analysis, next week: who knows? I&rsquo;m still fairly new to this, and I hope I will get better over time. If my comments haven&rsquo;t bored you to death, there is some further reading; many of these same ideas are crystallised in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/133313">Magical Realism and the Search for Identity in the Fiction of Murakami Haruki</a>, but it doesn&rsquo;t mention <em>Killing Commedatore</em> (as it&rsquo;s about 20 years too early). I also referenced <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/the-underground-worlds-of-haruki-murakami">this interview in the New Yorker</a> if you are after a more recent source. So, if you have reached the end, thank you once again, and I shall see you next week.</p>
