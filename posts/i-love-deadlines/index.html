A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have.<a class="anchor" href="#the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-has-a-few-things-to-say-on-the-subject-of-towels-a-towel-it-says-is-about-the-most-massively-useful-thing-an-interstellar-hitch-hiker-can-have">#</a></h2>
<p><em>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</em> (not the guide itself, the actual novel) occupies a rare space in the Western psyche - enough people know about it and are familiar with its material to get the reference but not enough are in order to illicit any sort of acknowledgement of the fact. It&rsquo;s a rare thing - I would also place in this category the influence of Akira Kurosawa and the tropes of samurai movies in the making of <em>Star Wars</em> and other sci-fi epics. Again, you&rsquo;d recognise him if he were pointed out, but otherwise, most people would (in my experience) shrug their shoulders and go &lsquo;Huh?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What?&rsquo;. Getting over that last boundary of apathy is what truly cements a work into our collective frame of reference. This last cultural hurdle, I think, is what allowed Hollywood to make a truly atrocious film out of it without fear of mass protest.</p>

<p>For such a new genre, comparatively speaking, science-fiction has done an awful lot. A rigorous scientific method itself has only existed for around a half-millennium at this point, depending on how you count. And yet, sci-fi, as it has become known, is one of the most popular genres around. I think this is because sci-fi (rebelling against the Victorian gothic sense of doom and gloom within an oppressive class-based hierarchy) is a genre of extrapolation - it imagines a future based upon the scientific trends of today, and more often than not assigns a moral value to this prediction. When an extrapolation turns out to be false, as is often the case, then sci-fi can age poorly. <em>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</em> is cleverer than that, however.</p>
<p><em>The Guide</em> (as it shall now be referred to) doesn&rsquo;t just perform this extrapolative effort that characterises a lot of science-fiction. Rather, it is reactive, satirising both existing sci-fi tropes and modern-day experiences. Curiously, (or, if you are a die-hard sci-fi fan, perversely) <em>The Guide</em> begins with the destruction of the Earth in order to make way for an &lsquo;hyperspatial express route&rsquo;. The trope of &lsquo;saving the planet&rsquo; or, if you really want to up the stakes &lsquo;saving the universe&rsquo; (which we can&rsquo;t really grasp the gravity of anyway), is a main-stay of conventional sci-fi. And Adams just does away with it!</p>
<p>In many ways, <em>The Guide</em> and associated trilogy of five part (or six, if you count <em>And Another Thing</em>) explores the absurdity of a disordered universe. Science fiction, by its nature, demands that reality is controlled by the same probabilistic reasoning that all science depends on in order to justify all the fantastical or un-real devices and mechanics it employs. It leans heavily on the old Arthur C. Clarke quote that, &lsquo;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic&rsquo;. Yet <em>The Guide</em> doesn&rsquo;t abide by this (usually unwritten) fact. Adams literally has God apologise from the mess he has created in the Final Message to His Creation, which says simply, &lsquo;We apologise for the inconvenience.&rsquo; Even Newton&rsquo;s Laws of Gravity are merrily tossed aside when Arthur spontaneously learns to fly by &lsquo;learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</em> revels in the collision of disorder when faced with the grandiose imagery and ideas of conventional sci-fi. It is, in my opinion, the first text that truly satirises science-fiction and comes at sci-fi&rsquo;s possibilities from an existential angle (a prime example is that the meaning to Life, the Universe and Everything, is, actually, 42). It doesn&rsquo;t just satirise the tropes of sci-fi (such as in John Scalzi&rsquo;s <em>Redshirts</em>) but strikes at the principal conceit of sci-fi itself. Adams gleefully turns two thermonuclear missiles into a whale and a bowl of petunias, has his character miss the spectacle of the end of the universe by five minutes in order to &lsquo;avoid the rush&rsquo;, and concludes <em>So Long and Thanks for All the Fish</em> with &lsquo;There was a point to this story, but it has temporarily escaped the chronicler&rsquo;s mind&rsquo;.</p>

<p>So, this has been another edition of <em>Almost Perceptive</em>. I know, I know, I missed a week. A glaring hole sits staring in the post history. I can only apologise for this misdemeanour. Perhaps I wanted to hear the &lsquo;whooshing sound&rsquo; of a deadline unfulfilled. In any case, thank you for reading, and I shall (most probably) see you all again next week.</p>
