<p>It&rsquo;s always difficult to begin something, I find. It&rsquo;s very easy to declare to yourself, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to do that thing that I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do, and I&rsquo;m going to start&hellip; wait for it&hellip; now!&rsquo; You might get a warm glow for a little while, flush with your own decisiveness and go-getter attitude, but in the heat of the moment, you never actually get around to doing anything at all. &lsquo;Oh, well&rsquo;, you might think, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s always tomorrow.&rsquo; And there usually is, short of some horrific accident.</p>
<p>However, the ability to turn that yearning into action is one that must be flexed, over time, like a muscle. This first post is a gentle warmup to what I hope will turn out to be a rather excellent mental work-out.</p>

<p>What you such read through, dear reader, was my perception of something. You may think differently, (ie. you are an amazing person who has followed through on every self-commitment you have ever made) and that is utterly and completely fine. That is why I have titled this little experiment &lsquo;Almost Perceptive&rsquo;. To be perceptive is to possess a key to a locked door that everyone knows can open, but nobody has actually put in the effort to call a decent locksmith. There I go again. Having another perception of something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very arrogant of me to assume that my thoughts and perceptions are of any use to anyone, although I hope they are. This whole affair is quite pointless otherwise.</p>
<p>So, if all goes to plan, there are many other posts besides this one. And that if I&rsquo;ve not very perceptive at the moment, please know that I&rsquo;m trying my utmost to be almost perceptive some time in the near future.</p>
