<p>The theme of this week appears to be bureaucracy. From the years-long mismanagement that caused a large store of ammonium nitrate to ignite in Beirut, or the scandal over exam results in the UK following the pandemic, incompetence and institutions appear to go hand in hand. The word people used to describe the opaque workings of national institution is &lsquo;Kafkaesque&rsquo;, where the object of power cannot be clearly seen. It was not just one man&rsquo;s failing that brought about the devastation in Beirut, but a large and complex web of smaller incompetencies and misunderstandings that led to one catastrophic conclusion. I want to talk about Kafka today, and how we can apply his &lsquo;parables&rsquo; to the world at large.</p>

<p>Many of the numerous commentaries of Kafka seems to assign him the status of a prophet - foreseeing the fascism of Nazi Germany, or the purges of the Stalinist state. This, however, misses the point; some see Kafka as a harbinger of worse things to come, but in fact he is commenting on his perception of the present. Like those whose writings are small but massively influential, a great deal of scholarly literature has been published discussing his &lsquo;parables&rsquo;, which are aphoristic in nature (To see the power of the aphorism, I suggest you read a <a href="https://almostperceptive.com/posts/a-shadow-of-itself/">previous post of mine</a> on the topic). In these parables, he gives a fascinating insight in the nature of power, authority, and violence.</p>
<p>Kafka&rsquo;s work, in particular <em>The Trial</em> present a deeply thoughtful analysis of institutions, in particular a &lsquo;total institution&rsquo; which aims to supervise and control all behaviours of those who exist under it. This brings to mind something akin to Jeremy Bentham&rsquo;s &lsquo;panopticon&rsquo; where every inmate in a hypothetical prison could be being watched at any moment but not every moment, effectively regulating their own behaviour. Kafka sees these &lsquo;total institutions&rsquo; springing forth in a post-industrialised world. In one enigmatic passage from <em>The Trial</em>, he states that &lsquo;everything belongs to the Court&rsquo;, suggesting that Kafka&rsquo;s constructed institution is supposed to reflect a &lsquo;total institution&rsquo;. From an existentialist viewpoint, such a institution is one of the ultimate examples of bad faith - a human, voluntarily (in the case of a school or hospital) or otherwise (in the case of a prison or asylum) denies their transcendence or freedom and becomes an mere object of the institution in question.</p>
<p>In the case of Josef K. in <em>The Trial</em>, bad faith occurs even before he is arrested. Many of Kafka&rsquo;s protagonists are model workers before the tragedy that befalls them. Even before the action takes places, the main character wholeheartedly accepts the rules of their given institution and its associated hierarchy, so that anything different becomes unthinkable. Even after being arrested and mistreated, K. becomes obsessed with the court, picturing it in the manner of his own organisation, complete with a vast and opaque web of officials and bureaucrats.</p>
<p>In his portrayal of bureaucracy, Kafka also deftly captured another characteristic of modern institutions - namely, the invisibility of their rulers. In Kafka&rsquo;s work, organisations are headed by lowly managers and directors, with traditional rulers appearing as ineffectual figureheads. This abstracts power away from almost everyone and instead puts in place a system of mutual oppression. This is not only illustrated by K. but also the flogger, who simply says &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been hired to flog, and flog I will&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This sounds bleak, but there is a ray of hope. Yes, one of the most depressing aspects of institutions is that they gain power from the acquiescence of those they control. But, if one withdraws their acquiescence, theoretically, one deprives the institution of its power. Kafka gives an aphorism on this fact -</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;They were given the choice of being kings or kingâ€™s couriers. Like children, they all wanted to be couriers. So now there are only couriers; they dash through the world, and as there are no kings shout their meaningless messages to one another. They would gladly put an end to their wretched lives, but they dare not because of their oath of loyalty.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Simply, there is no authority, but people persist as if there were. Still, this is only in the mind - what can we practically do? We can engage in what Hannah Arendt calls &lsquo;action&rsquo;, in the way humans disclose themselves to others and distinguish themselves from others as unique and irreplaceable beings. Institutions, as we know them today and as Kafka shows, attempt to turn action into &lsquo;work&rsquo; (meeting our biological needs like eating and sleeping) and &lsquo;labour&rsquo; (creating a new object from existing ones with a clearly defined beginning and end).</p>
<p>Our resistance and freedom aren&rsquo;t futile, but institutions want us to think they are. Let&rsquo;s prove them wrong.</p>

<p>I think this is one of the longest entries into <em>Almost Perceptive</em> yet. It&rsquo;s much more polemical than last week, but I never said I would be consistent. A accessible and comprehensive collection of commentary on Kafka is &lsquo;Kafka in the 21st century&rsquo; which can be found <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt1x72j1">here</a>, and for Kafka&rsquo;s works, Penguin Classics do an <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0241372550/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_eQRmFbPRJDWWM">excellent anthology</a>. It&rsquo;s been a stressful week, so I&rsquo;m glad to see that a fair few posts have accrued over the last few week, hopefully providing me with the motivation to do more once life fully resumes. Thanks, and see you next week.</p>
