<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that the West has a inequality problem. Since 1980, the share of overall income going to the top 1% of earners in the US, UK and Australia has increased sharply. In fact, the economist Thomas Piketty has even gone so far to say that the US has a level of inequality &lsquo;probably higher than in any other society at any time in the past, anywhere in the world&rsquo;. The socio-economic effects of this has been discussed extensively, but that is not what I want to discuss. Inequality has another side-effect - it creates bad design for everyone, whether poor or rich.</p>
<p>One genre that has captured what a city embracing its inequality would look like is cyberpunk. Images are conjured of vast, monolithic skyscrapers against a backdrop of bright neon light and poverty-stricken tower blocks; modernism gone rancid. This is unequal-ness personified. Gone are the pastoral cottages or suburban sprawl (also bad design, but I&rsquo;ll get onto that) but instead a physical us-and-them. Towers no longer made out of ivory but out of steel and glass.</p>

<p>Outside of newer cities, this image as not come to pass, at least not at the rate that it was predicated. Los Angeles in 2019 doesn&rsquo;t look like it did in Blade Runner. The effects of inequality on the aesthetics around us are subtler, in the little things. For example, London’s urban space has, in recent years, undergone rapid change by large-scale gentrification ‘designed’ to increase land value for private developers. Here, the way in which develop deploy ‘aesthetics’ becomes a core mechanism for a brutal form of segmentation that is brought upon whole neighbourhoods and communities. It&rsquo;s why every high-end hotel looks the same, no matter the city they are in - a kind of upper class oasis that moves at its own leisurely pace, regardless of the architectural eddies swirling around it.</p>
<p>This is what designer Kyle Chayka calls &lsquo;AirSpace&rsquo;. He criticises a global &lsquo;harmonisation of tastes&rsquo; drawing upon the example of coffee shops and the proliferation of the reclaimed wood, Edison bulbs and exposed brick aesthetic. Cyberpunk brings us an &lsquo;AirSpace&rsquo; of a different kind, no longer quasi-artisanal, but industrial and imposing. As a smaller and more influential groups of people move through an increasingly globalised world, aesthetics converge and prevents innovation or individuality. This paradox - more global, less unique - is present in those who attempt to sell people aesthetics, like AirBnB. Originally promising a authentic, alien experience of another city, now all potential dwellings look more or less the same. It&rsquo;s not bad (as in unpleasant), but it is bad design.</p>
<p>This is because we forget the flipside. It&rsquo;s not enough to say you belong to the &lsquo;AirSpace&rsquo; class or not; we need to consider the spaces forgotten by development, liminal spaces when the poorest are left behind. Gentrification (literally, making an area more &lsquo;noble&rsquo;) acts as an instrument for the engraining of existing inequalities and asymmetries. The value of other spaces, away from &lsquo;AirSpace&rsquo; is systematically forgotten, reducing the capacity for innovation.</p>
<p>This is not to put the blame on the designers who create these unequitable spaces. Someone else would design them anyway - and designers have a vital role to playing in pushing forward to come up with more efficient designs for buildings as the population booms, especially in developing countries. However, not acknowledging the dynamics between places, politics and power, we reduce and belittle our own cultural heritage. Allowing a forum to discuss the complex tensions between the community, urban planners, designers and stakeholder will allow us to breach the &lsquo;AirSpace&rsquo; and allow design to continue to experiment and innovate, forming more cultural sedimental layers once again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a coincidence that &lsquo;AirSpace&rsquo; has emerged as the same time inequality has grown. The purpose of design is to allow humans to function more effectively, and the rich do not know best. Stagnation in the aesthetics around us constrain us, acting as a kind of material false consciousness. It&rsquo;s time we break out of it.</p>

<p>This has been another <em>Almost Perceptive</em> entry. It&rsquo;s a little later than usual, but still on a Tuesday(just!). As always, thank you for reading and, if you want to read more about things discussed above, fear not! There is a reading list. <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/researchingsociology/2016/09/12/inequality-by-design-why-we-need-to-start-talking-about-aesthetics-design-and-politics/">This blog</a> from the LSE proved helpful in introducing me to Chayka, whose ideas you can read more about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/hipster-aesthetic-taking-over-world">here</a>. In addition, I would recommend <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiaiLKX3_DqAhXAQkEAHfcgDEsQFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmonoskop.org%2Fimages%2F7%2F78%2FKoolhaas_Rem_1995_The_Generic_City.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2hua7daKmcyWLFpzGYyHdz">&lsquo;The Generic City&rsquo;</a> an essay published by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas who also rallied against the the homogenisation of taste. Thank you for reading, and hope to catch you next week.</p>
