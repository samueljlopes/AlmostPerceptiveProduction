<h2 id="the-eternal-silence-of-these-endless-spaces-terrifies-me---blaise-pascal">&lsquo;The eternal silence of these endless spaces terrifies me.&rsquo; - Blaise Pascal<a class="anchor" href="#the-eternal-silence-of-these-endless-spaces-terrifies-me---blaise-pascal">#</a></h2>
<p>In Andrew Hui&rsquo;s book &lsquo;A Theory of the Aphorism&rsquo; (which you can purchase <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691188959/a-theory-of-the-aphorism">here</a>), he describes aphorisms as a phrase which &lsquo;condenses&rsquo;. It transforms a epic into a book, a book into a page, and a page into a single, pithy phrase that can be thought upon and pondered over, relentlessly. Hui picks six key thinkers as representative of his theories on aphorism - three &lsquo;ancients&rsquo;, three &lsquo;moderns&rsquo;. There is a pleasing symmetry to this, although the millennium-and-a-half jump between the Gospel of Thomas and the <em>Adages</em> of Erasmus is a little jarring.</p>
<p>Rather than bemoan the fragmentary nature of how these aphorisms are passed down to us, Hui integrates this fact into his philosophy (or rather, philology) of aphorisms. According to him, an aphorism is a dialogue between fragments and systems. Eschewing the need to collate and review, Hui draws a comparison between how aphorisms and its state of transmission reflect each other.</p>

<p>By being incomplete (fragmentary, so to speak), we are able to express an impossible desire for endless signification. Take one of the oldest philosophical aphorism - &lsquo;know thyself&rsquo;, once said to be inscribed upon the forecourt of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. By being incomplete - literally taken from ruins - the aphorism can be read in almost any way you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>Another aphorism springs to mind on this; from Debussy, who isn&rsquo;t mentioned in the book, but is in passing in a relevant <a href="https://entitledopinions.stanford.edu/andrew-hui-aphorism">podcast</a>, &lsquo;Music is the space between the notes&rsquo;. The disconnected nature of an aphorism (as opposed to prose, in which sentences are pushed together and are implicitly if not explicity connected) allows for more &lsquo;fluid and expansive hermeneutic possibilities&rsquo;. Basically, think what you like. The author does not provide an explanation, although their disciples and students might. A reader must do the heavy lifting themselves, forging and reconstructing a chain of thoughts which will differ wildly from interpreter to interpreter.</p>
<p>Not only are aphorisms incomplete from context, but, as Hui notes, collections and theories of the aphorism are also unfinished too. Bacon&rsquo;s <em>Instauratio magna</em>, the aforementioned <em>Adages</em> and Nietzsche&rsquo;s alleged magnum opus <em>Will to Power</em> are all woefully half-done. Not wanting to break this rather unique tradition, a disclaimer is included - this is not <em>the</em> but rather <em>a</em> theory, and he invites the reader to come up with their own ideas. Like those he analyses, Hui leaves his work wonderfully, tantalisingly, unfinished.</p>

<p>So, dear reader, we have come to the end of the first proper post of <em>Almost Perceptive</em>. If you refer back to my last post, you&rsquo;ll see that I began this experiment (and it is still an experiment) with another aphorism of sorts, by Aldous Huxley. The title of this post is another as well, an aphorism on aphorism (meta-aphorism?) from the poet Don Paterson. If nothing else, they make for terrific headings. I hope to expand operations, so to speak, over the coming weeks, so if you have a particularly good aphorism, adage or motto, let me know via the appropriate channels of communication.</p>
