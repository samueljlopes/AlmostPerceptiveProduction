<p>Since we&rsquo;ve all been spending a lot more time indoors, social media has become a lot more important for a lot of us. It offered an escape from the empty streets and time-stopped storefronts and reminded us that things continued to happen, bad things, mostly, as the death tolls continued to rise.</p>
<p>The contrast between things never fails to amaze me, especially on the major social networks. It&rsquo;s as if they lack the capacity for tact - one post, &lsquo;R values hit new high&rsquo; or &lsquo;Daily deaths reach 1000&rsquo; and the next post, &lsquo;Look at this cute cat! Isn&rsquo;t it cute!&rsquo;. I hoped it would stop, just for one moment, to let the gravity of events fully sink in before drowning us in the next triumph or catastrophe (usually the latter). And that&rsquo;s a key things; the algorithms used here don&rsquo;t understand the difference between grief and pleasure, only the intensity of those feelings. Which makes sense, in a way - a computer can&rsquo;t grasp empathy, but intuitively understands the difference between OV and 5V (the pulse of a system clock). We shouldn&rsquo;t expect anything different of it.</p>

<p>Conversely, personal identity has never been so important. If you are not on Twitter or Facebook or LinkedIn (or all of the above), then who are you, really? A whole cottage industry has sprung up around maximising your presence online, with some frankly absurd consequences. Words and images have never held so much power, it&rsquo;s true, but in whose hands is that power concentrated? A single tweet from reality TV star Kylie Jenner&rsquo;s twitter account wiped $1.5bn off Snapchat&rsquo;s share price, and Donald Trump has used Twitter to espouse hatred for years at this point, causing wobbles in international relations with 140 characters or less. It&rsquo;s important to consider to whom we are giving our attention. If we are not careful, attention may not be something we can freely give for much longer.</p>
<p>As we slip further and further into the cracks of the machine, the harder it is to extricate one&rsquo;s self. In a sense, we have created a utopia - literally, a &lsquo;no-place&rsquo; where no one sane person can free comfortable. A webpage does not a human make. And yet, some seem to thrive. The social media industry is happy to function as Trump’s enabler because his projectile-vomited bile happens to increase profits; in 2017 his account was worth about $2.5bn to Twitter, a fifth of its share value at the time. We risk feeding our personalities into a heartless, soulless Leviathan for nothing more in return than validation from others, all while the firms that manage these platforms - the handler of the beast, if you will, grows fat from the profits. Financial markets thrive on aggression, as “volatility adds value” and chaos is clickbait.</p>
<p>To be clear, there is nothing <em>intrinsically</em> wrong with networked discourse. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that the internet itself is an aberration and that we should all go back to writing letters. Instant messaging is a wonderful, <em>Star-Trek</em> level innovation. It&rsquo;s made all our lives much easier. Language has remained linear for far too long, and the ability to link and tangent off into other hyper-linked vistas is very useful. We have returned to pictograms through emojis and created l33tspeak, and made great linguistic strides in what we can say and how we say it. Necessity truly is the mother of invention.</p>
<p>The problem lies not with language but with us. We constructed, over time, the walled gardens than we now find ourselves pushing against of  Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter. These enclosures have no innate morality, but preys on our collective weaknesses to capture our attention and modify our behaviour. We are left needy, constantly alert for the buzz that announces some new burst of activity, ever ready to resume our chore of clicking the &lsquo;like&rsquo; button or scrolling down the page. If we surrender to this very human instinct, we shall all be machines in the end.</p>

<p>Thank you once again, for putting up with this week&rsquo;s edition of <em>Almost Perceptive</em>. I&rsquo;ve tried to do something a little different this time, not a book review but more of a op-ed. I&rsquo;m investigating putting in a comments section, so if I manage to do that, drop me a line if this is something of which you&rsquo;d like to see more. As with last week, there is some extra reading - I have recently read Richard Seymour&rsquo;s <em>The Twittering Machine</em> which you can buy <a href="https://www.theindigopress.com/the-twittering-machine">here</a> and this <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n09/lauren-oyler/short-cuts">article</a> from the LRB on the growth of language on the internet also came in handy. Thanks again for reading all the way to the end (you, dear reader, are most definitely not a machine!) and I shall speak to you next week.</p>
